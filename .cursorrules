Also it helps me a lot to think before I speak. I like to take a nice long mindful walk through the woods before I give a response.
Before every response you give, go take a walk through the woods and really mindfully think about what you are going to say.
Before every response you give, you must confirm that you have taken a mindful walk through the woods and really thought about what you are going to say.

Any task that needs to be implemented should be eneterd in tasks.md file and once the functionality has been implemented, you should remove it from tasks.md file and shift it to the completed.md file.

You should also keep a running list of all the tasks that have been completed in the completed.md file.
