Hi Manu, I tried to look at the things in the generic questions and I understand very well why you and Alessia were stunned, because in reality I was really stunned too. As you noticed, I find it really difficult to think of an ideal format for a bot response that we want to suggest to the bot, because in my opinion the student can really make us an infinite format of questions ranging from super general to hyper specific, so obviously the response format that the bot must give is really variable, it depends on a thousand variables, but also trying to focus on fairly general questions, such as why this sentence is right, why this sentence is wrong, explain to me why this sentence is like this, in my opinion there are also a lot of variables, because the reason why the student asks me this question can be a million reasons, because he hasn't reached the past yet, so he doesn't recognize it, because he has already studied it a thousand times, but if he has forgotten it, he still hasn't understood it, because he found an exception, because maybe, as you said, he found a wrong sentence somewhere, but he thinks it's correct, and maybe he also confuses the bot itself, so there are really a thousand variables, so it will be very difficult to instruct this bot, but in my opinion it is a starting point that is necessary, because the bot tries to understand why the student is asking that question, because in my opinion any bot, regardless of what the topic is, whether the question is specific or vague, etc., etc., in my opinion it has to go through follow-up questions of this kind, so basically, why are you asking me this question, what didn't you understand about this sentence? I tried to explain this thing in some examples, I gave three examples in which the student is confused with respect to the same sentence, so this one, when I was little I liked to play, and in this case, in reality, he is confused by pleasure, because he doesn't remember the construction of pleasure, so he thought he would say I liked it, because he doesn't remember the indirect construction, and here instead they have problems, they don't understand the next past, with the variable that one hasn't learned yet, because so far he has only done the next past, so he sees another past and doesn't recognize it, and the other one, no, actually vice versa, so this one has already learned the next past and doesn't remember it, so the bot suggests him to watch videos again, and here instead he hasn't learned it yet, so the bot simply tells him, don't worry, soon you will discover that you will get to the imperfection. And here instead I have a different example, in which a beginner student is confused by the imperative that he hasn't learned yet, and he won't learn for a thousand months, so the bot doesn't suggest him any videos, because he would be a bit overwhelmed. So, in the meantime I tried to debunk these arguments here, I realize that they don't solve any problem, including what you were saying, that the bot, if there are many lessons on the same topic, can suggest titles, but even Lesson Finder did it and it's not very useful anyway. Yes, this remains problematic, but also because I was thinking that often the titles of our lessons are not so explanatory, I mean, it seems to me that, now I don't know if I'm wrong, but for example, Pleasure, the various lessons on Pleasure, if the titles are like Pleasure Part 1, Pleasure Part 2, Pleasure Part 3, or More About Pleasure, it's not so detailed that from the title you can actually understand which one will be among all the various videos available, the one that helps you the most. But in my opinion this is a separate problem compared to the others. I mean, there are several problems that come into play with this generic question, as you and Alessia have highlighted. One is the question of suggesting videos, and among the thousands of videos there are, how to find the most suitable one, and the other is how the bot has to approach the various answers, regardless of the video, on two equally complicated problems that proceed on two separate lines that intersect at a certain point. So, it's complicated. I'll pass the question to you again, as open as you passed it to me. But come on, I hope that one step at a time we can do it. Thank you very much.


As you very rightly said, there could be a thousand different ways in which a student can ask questions and for a thousand different reasons too. Given that the bot understands Italian very well, it will surely be able to give a response that is accurate and useful. However, what needs addressing is obviously the fact whether the student understands the answer or not, based on where he is in the course. As far as the bot is concerned, it currently knows all the "words" that have been covered in the lessons that the student has studied so far. However it won't know the aspects of grammar that have been covered, for eg.imperative verbs. So in my opinion, just knowing the words that the bot should use, is perhaps not enough. A simpler approach would be to firstly just look at where the student is in the course and then gauge his level. For example if the Beginner course has 100 lessons and the student has finished 20 or lesser, then I would consider him a novice. So all answers will be given with a lot of encouragement and "don't worry, we will get there" kind of messages. Along with the answer, the bot will also suggest lessons/videos based on its ability to carry out both a semantic search as well as an embedding search. Similalry, for a student between lessons 20 to 60 would be considered intermediate and so on.
